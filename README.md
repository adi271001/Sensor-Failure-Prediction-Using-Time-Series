# Sensor-Failure-Prediction-Using-Time-Series
Step 1:
EDA and Data Preprocessing and Creation Of Baseline Model

Step 2:
re-examine our assumption of RUL and fit an SVR to get a better score.

Step 3:
develop a distributed lag model to predict the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) i.e time series model

Step 4:
develop a Survival Regression model on the  dataset for predictive maintenance. As the results of the chosen Survival model does not directly inform us of the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of the engines, we fit a second model to get an indication of RUL
